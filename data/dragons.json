So, when the wizard that discovered it, Donlo, invited it to the party, tebori didn't even hesitate for a second. Tebori was fairly new to the Vale and upon arrival it got many double takes, but only because everyone was mesmerised by the beautiful patterns on its body. Some wizards speculate these are powerful spells written in tebori's native language, others claim it’s a map to a different Vale. No one dared to ask what they were though. As the night progressed, everyone was enjoying themselves, but tebori was keeping its distance, as it was feeling a bit down because of all the looks it got at the start. That was until the chromacorn dragon arrived and went straight to it to say \"\"Hi\"\". Both friends ended up catching up for lost time and having fun all evening at the beach. No one was looking in their direction anymore, which is a pity because they looked so perfect standing together."

He was told that at this time of year, this time of day, localized in Seebear, he would be able to see it.  With his camp set and fire lit, he sat back and looked up to the night sky to enjoy the spectacle.  He had heard stories of how beautiful it was but no one ever mentioned it would make sounds similar to that of a dragon breathing and yawning.  Realizing what was actually making the noise, he turned towards the source and saw a little baby lyuba dragon that had gotten lost from its herd, and had cuddled next to his fire.  His heart melted at the sight and made himself a promise, that he would help with finding its herd the next day.  The lyuba dragons were so happy to see Koody returning the calf, that they welcomed him into the herd, which eventually led them to the Vale."

This year was no exception to the tradition, and a bunch of wizards headed towards the lake, but when they arrived an unusual picture unravelled before their eyes. The meadow with the flowers was looking very different. The grass was completely crushed, the flower stems broken in half, the bushes dried out without a single berry on them...The wizards couldn't believe their eyes as this was the territory of the flowerhop dragons, and they were usually taking extremely good care of the surrounding nature. It didn't take the wizards too much time to figure out what had happened, as they quickly focused on an oval flowerhop dragon laying under a now receding bush of zazzberries and eating with delight. Flowerhop dragons had a sweet tooth for zazzberries and started consuming them in enormous quantity this past year. Soon enough when they tried to hop onto the flowers, the stems would just break in half under the weight which resulted in a chonky dragon rolling down the meadow. Hopefully these wizards will help them out a bit, because otherwise we will have to go out and discover a treehop dragon..."

She found a calm meadow and began to play her harp and became lost in the music. She played for several hours until she heard a harmony join her chorus. The young witch looked for the source of the sweet music and was awed to see an embossed dragon had joined her, using the strings strung on its tail to accompany the music. The song continued into the night -- witch and dragon celebrating not only past years, but bright ones to come."

To settle the disagreement between the two claims, the bravest of the Valers decided to go and see for themselves.  Days and days of venturing into a deep valley passed, and our adventurers happened upon several gryphus dragons sleeping quite soundly.  In the middle there was an enormous pile of what looked to be letters and parcels.  Little did our Valers know, the gryphus kind were once trusted messengers, with maybe not so great habit of keeping their charge for themselves.  Thus, the legend of a vast hoard of knowledge was born.  Technically, it still is a source of information, just not the kind everyone thought of."

With their instinct to find, keep and hoard gold, it isn't too absurd to suggest the redbeard and yarr dragons are related in some way."

He hobbled through brambles and branches and arrived at a still pond. The grey water was an unlikely place to find Gardenia and when that observation sunk in, Whitbee sighed heavily. He heard gurgling and pounded his chest as if it were indigestion, but he soon looked up to see bubbles surfacing in the middle of the pond.\nHe pointed his gnarled staff at the water and summoned several lightning strikes around the perimeter. The water was instantly evaporated. Down at the bottom was a single gathering of cyclamen flowers. Whitbee dropped his staff to his side and muttered, \"What did I expect?\"\nAs he walked away, a raucous flapping deafened him and a wild blue blur landed in his path. Whitbee froze. As he gathered his wits, he determined it could only be a sullen cyclamen dragon. It stared at the wizard, but didn't blink.\nWhitbee transmuted the head of his staff to represent Gardenia, pointed to it, and gestured all around them with a shrug. The cyclamen dragon's eyes watered and it walked away. Whitbee didn't understand and was left alone. he stumbled to keep up with the dragon and found it had stopped at a lake. The cyclamen dragon nodded toward the water. \"I guess it's worth a shot,\" Whitbee mumbled. He blasted the lake with lightning, but there was nothing at the bottom.\nThe dragon led Whitbee to a river, then a stream, and even a puddle. But there was no point. Nothing was under these bodies of water. Whitbee sat on a log, exhausted. The cyclamen dragon lied down next to him and rested its head on his lap."

Nogard unfurled a scroll with Gardenia's likeness inked on it and showed it to the creature. The petunia dragon looked and raised an eyebrow at Nogard.\nThe dragon looked around and pointed toward a cave with its snout. Nogard bowed as a sign of deferment and the petunia dragon led the way. At the mouth of the cave, the dragon waited for the wizard to catch up. It simply stared as Nogard looked into the dark void. The dragon tapped a talon and waited for the wizard to do something. Nogard realized the creature was waiting and drew his wand. \"Oh, right. Sight might be useful.\" Nogard cast a spell and turned his wand into a torch. They ventured into the cave together.\nThe petunia dragon grunted and ran ahead of Nogard, but was consumed by darkness. It angrily roared which shook the cave, along with Nogard's sense of safely. The wise wizard took it as a sign and quickly conjured sheets of fire to cover the entired labyrinth of cavern walls. The petunia dragon was visible again and smirked.\nHours later, they emerged with heads hung low. Nogard flipped over the parchment with Gardenia on it and summoned a map to show all other cave locations. He marked an X on one and pointed to another.

After breaking it free they became fast friends, flying back to the Jubilee together.\nThe reminiscence dragon shared everyone's memories they had of the Vale, growing more warm, sweet, and rich with the passage of time."

He walked closer with mouth agape. As he reached down to touch the plant, a part of it popped up from the ground. It wasn't a flower at all, but a dragon's head!\nAt that moment, Kaleni knew there was hope. If a dragon could hold on to its color, maybe it could help fix the whole Vale. The dragon sniffed and looked around, confused and out of place. Kaleni didn't recognize it. It looked like a daffodil but didn't respond to the name. Kaleni tried several variations until arriving at daffadowndilly. The dragon excitedly ran around him in circles.\nAfter having figured out its proper name, Kaleni showed the dragon a scroll with Gardenia's picture. The daffadowndilly dragon jumped up and down and ran back to where its head was stuck. It tried digging into the ground, but all it found was dirt.\nKaleni contacted other House Witches and Wizards and spread the word that these undiscovered flower dragons may hold the key to Gardenia's disappearance."

When he returned, the people hardly recognized the cheerful, boisterous, and much rounder wizard as the same gloomy Master Wizard they had known. It was said that the old Orlon had gone forever, and the new Orlon was full of life and joy -- using his powerful magic now only for the creation of world class food and drink.

He stumbled up and kicked his flying vehicle into gear. He flew it around the Cooperative Breeding Cave and saw the egg was hurtling toward a Galaxy Island. He parked in the egg's path and stood at the edge with arms wide open. Unfortunately, the egg cracked and started hatching mid-flight.\nTolzar's eyes widened and he quickly rummaged through a chest of inventions. He heard a loud CRACK and popped up holding a giant net. He saw a baby rigel dragon emerge from the broken shell. Tolzar cackled with glee, but the baby dragon saw the net and zipped over to the Galaxy Island. It eagerly scooped up a mouthful of Dragon Treats as it continued to tumble through the air.\nIt instantly grew into a juvenile but still couldn't control its newly discovered wings. Tolzar was determined to save this lost, haphazard soul so he raced his vehicle in the dragon's path yet again. Right before the rigel juvenile hit Tolzar's net, the dragon created a portal and disappeared into it. ZAP! There was no sign of it.\nTolzar shrugged and flew away. He was disappointed he couldn't save the dragon from such a random fate. ZAP! A portal opened back up and the shockwave sent Tolzar's Optical Oracle spiraling out of control. Tozar yelped with panic until a fully grown adult rigel dragon flew in front of him and gently stopped his careening contraption.\nThe now confident rigel dragon winked at the strange wizard who had offered futile help earlier in its life."

One of the novices had to reignite their torch soon after, and by accident conjured a fireball instead of a spark, sending it flying far into the cave. The group waited for the fireball to land before proceeding, but instead of the fireball landing, what they heard was the sound of the eldest Wizard slapping the novice by the neck. Further down they started to smell something strange, something like burnt hair. By the time the realization hit them, one of the Wizards had bumped into something steady and fuzzy in the darkness. Looking up they saw a yawning yeti dragon, towering above them with charred brows and hair. The lonely dragon, thrilled to see it had visitors, smiled from horn to horn, exposing a big toothy grin. Thinking it was about to turn them into tonight's meal, the Wizards quickly dropped everything and ran to the exit, arms flailing in the air. Still sleepy, the yeti dragon went after its new friends to hug and play with them. These dragons had adapted perfectly to their environment, thick fur to keep them warm, strength to push over boulders and snow out of their way, and they had no need for wings in these tight spaces so it was quickly catching up to them. The eldest Wizard hastily conjured a teleportation spell to get them out of there, sending them all directly back to the Vale. They only had a second to celebrate and cheer when they realized, the teleportation spell that supposedly saved them also took the yeti with them to the Vale, which gave them all a group hug with a smug smile on its face."

After trying the whole day to blend different types of herbs, plants and other unknown substances, and with each attempt being somehow less successful than the last, he threw everything in an old planter in frustration, promising himself to clean it up in the morning.  However, the next morning he was awoken not by the pleasant sounds of chirping, but by a loud thud, so he quickly jumped out of bed to investigate.  He hurried to the room where he experimented the previous day and noticed the planter he was planning on throwing away was gone.  He wondered for a moment if he misplaced it without remembering, but upon closer inspection found it shattered on the ground.  And the reason for it - a fushi dragon.  A dragon created from a bunch of random ingredients put in a bit of dirt overnight.  You might think it's a recipe for disaster, but that fushi dragon rolling in the dirt with such joy surely can't be trouble.  R-right?"

It could see by the faintest of sight, a trepak dragon had gathered a somewhat peculiar group of dragons in the center of town. The jadice dragon swooped in, right in the middle of an apparent stare-down. The jadice dragon approached the trepak dragon and intercepted the glare. Avarice, gulletail, lokilure, and burglehoo dragons all stepped back with reverence when the jadice dragon separated the group. Just then, the jolliest of wizards interrupted. It was Sandakloz and he wanted to set things straight. Witches and wizards gathered to hear him speak.\nHe explained how no dragon is wholly bad and no dragon is purely good, much like the witches and wizards they lived with. Sandakloz gave each dragon a medal with the letter \"N\" emblazoned upon it and said, \"Remember, each day we have the option to be naughty or nice. But no one except ourselves, can be the bearer of that change.\"\nFrom that moment on, dragons of all kinds and magicfolk from around the Vale worked together to revive the Vale. As dawn snuck up, a winter wonderland was revealed! That night forged a tradition that still thrives to this very day. The festival may have a different name from time to time, but the spirit remains the same."

Across the Vale, every dragon, witch, and wizard stopped to watch this technicolor anomaly.\nAs the apparent bubble pierced through a low hanging cloud, it split into the magnificent wings of a pearlescent dragon. Some say, they heard a collective gasp escape from every living creature. The pearlescent dragon stretched out like a rainbow sail and craned its head downward. It unleashed a single blast of glitter and colors that inundated the cave with unmatched force. A glowing orange sphere was illuminated around the cave.\nOn an adjacent island, Kaleni could see the orange sphere materialize while peeking between blocking trilobite dragons. His jaw dropped, \"I don't believe it\", he blurted out.\n\"Believe what?\", the young witch, Ellie, replied.\nKaleni simply said, \"It WAS my fault.\"\nThe pearlescent dragon fired off another sparkling blast. It made contact with the glowing orange sphere and amplified it to a searing red. It pulsed hotter and brighter until it shattered into a thousand pieces.\nThe trilobite dragons dropped their guard, the pearlescent dragon landed, and all the chrysalis dragons stood on the ground together. They looked at each other with grins and sighed. They instantly tensed up again when they heard a rustling from inside the cave. The pearlescent dragon opened its mouth again ready to unleash beauteous fury. Before more magic breath was loosed, Kaleni came running out. The dragons relaxed.\n\"My friends, I'm so sorry this happened. Next spring will be different. I promise. If you ever get hungry, just stop by my treat farm. No questions asked.\""

He loved to travel and visited a lot of known and unknown places, but as the years passed, his vision started to let him down a bit.  On one of his trips to yet another exotic island, a long-tailed dragon grabbed his attention.  He didn't know what to call it at first, but took it along on his voyages and trained it how to drive the tip of its tail on the ground, launched itself and balance on top of it in order to keep an eye for other ships and land.  Esesh even tried giving it his spyglass to help it spot things easier, but the dragon, not knowing what to do with it simply threw it overboard.  With time, more and more wizards started taking such a dragon on their trips, because it really seemed to enjoy balancing on its sturdy tail and being on the lookout for potentially approaching difficulties.  Nowadays, almost all ships and boats have it onboard.  And hence when brave wizards would shout \"Ahoy!\" to call on a ship or a boat, the dragon would respond to that instead, as if they're calling its name.  Next time you're thinking of using this exact signal word, remember that you're calling to a dragon, not a vessel."

If you start chanting the dragon's true name and turn off your lantern, just as you chant it the fifth time, a shadowy figure will then claw its way out of the mirror, possess the tent, spit you out and take the form of a spooky dragon.  The true name of the dragon is a closely kept secret, but campers call it umbra for its shadowy appearance."

As soon as a genuine snore bellowed out of its snout, the loudest squawk in the Vale echoed everywhere. The avarice dragon's eyes popped open; it stood straight up, and banged its head on a low-hanging stalactite. It groaned and snarled with hackles standing on end. It marched toward the mouth of the cave to find the cause of its unpleasant awakening, yet there was nothing there. It took flight and soared over the Vale until it spotted a boisterous choir and a contributing libretto dragon. It let out a giant roar that scattered the singers and even emade the libretto dragon hide. Satisfied, the avarice dragon flew back home to its cave..."

Attempts to separate the entwined dragons by force have left many wizards with charred eyebrows, and clever use of magic has made both dragons sad and lonely after spending time apart from their partner.  The dispute was then quickly ended, as they appear to be seemingly inseparable, since they find partners as soon as they hatch, with their tails and fates forever entwined."

The eldritch dragon drew its now burning wings together and, with a blinding flash, rocketed away.\nJust then, Whitbee emerged from the darkness and pointed his wand at the fire-lit trail left by the eldritch dragon.

From these cracks, certain sections mysteriously writhed.\nSeveral massive trilobite dragons broke loose from the ground and stretched their ancient wings, crackling and groaning in unison. They flew up high and observed the entire Vale as if for the very first time. Every newly discovered chrysalis dragon observed the awakening of the trilobite dragons and instinctually travelled to their location. With the innate understanding that danger was lurking, the trilobite dragons chased the remaining Valers to an overgrown magic portal. After the magicfolk were safe on other islands, the trilobite dragons formed a shield with their bodies while floating in midair and blocked the Vale from potential rogue effects.\nThe other eight dragon types unleashed their varied breath magic at the Burcadian Breeding Cave... but nothing happened. The trilobite dragons stayed vigilant with their guard even though progress was not made. The dragons kept firing their breath at the cave until all became winded. At that moment, something sparkled high above them..."

No one has ever seen them before, which is weird considering how weird of a sound they make when moving. But now, they're a preferred company in the Vale, because of their personality. They're so transparent that you can see right through them. But in a good sense, of course."

When the time came, the delicia dragon was called on the stage and faced its opponent. Loud music started playing, the crowd was cheering, and some very interesting dancing was happening. The delicia dragon was on fire, dancing like crazy and the more intricate moves it did, more eyes were glued to it. It was having the best performance of its life. But the reason why so many were looking at it was because it was just flailing its wings and tail around and twirling all over the place. It still won, though."

Seeing the black and red streak of the eldritch dragon turn sharply in its direction, it rocketed past and as it did so, the eldritch dragon's colors changed yet again, now resembling the pale and sickly green of the macabre dragon.\nAt the Bizarre Bazaar, Nogard surmised that they should start to clean up the mess that had been created in order to help Whitbee. Using their wands to repair and clean, Kaleni conjured up some snacks so that no one would go hungry.\nWhitbee reappeared just in time to see the eldritch dragon land in the clearing in front of the portal as the other dragons followed suit. Sensing that the ordeal would soon be over, Whitbee sighed in relief, until Lumi, visibly exasperated by now, exclaimed, \"you accidentally summoned that dragon didn't you!? Then you summoned the four apocalyptic hunters to assist you right\"? Sheepishly, Whitbee replied, \"yes, I did, but I wouldn't have gotten away with it if it weren't for you meddling wizards, and for that I thank you\".\nThe shrounds that covered the eldritch dragon began to phase in and out of view blinking faster and faster until they disappeared entirely leaving a very awkward eldritch dragon standing there. \"You know, this poor dragon didn't really do any harm to the Vale, and could stay if it likes\", said Gardenia. \"It can leave any time it wants as can these four hunters!\" In an attempt to lighten the mood, Kaleni declared, \"I'd make an apocalypse pun right now, but armageddon the feeling it wouldn't go over well\".

They get a kick out of using their tails to discharge into the ground, think of it as the dragon equivalent of cracking your back."

You will see a mylio dragon's weird, but rather funny, mixture of dancing, acrobatics and other movements that no wizard can do. Shortly after, a wave of calmness and serenity (and maybe some splashed lake water) will embrace you. Surely, mylio dragons would give great calming hugs. But they don't have any limbs. Sadly. \nP.S.

Its age is unknown, but wizards guess it's been around for quite some time.  Its interesting name doesn't stand for leadership, but for wisdom and timelessness.  Many would look up to it and ask for advice on different occasions, because this dragon is said to be all-seeing.  There isn't a single Valer, witch or wizard it doesn't know or hasn't heard of.  For that reason everyone loved it and invited it to multiple different gatherings.  And that night was no exception.  Alffa met with its friends oaris, exandrew, hanno, grove, delicia and tebori on the beach and they ended up chatting all evening.  They met up on the same beach last year's party was, so they can all talk about their sweet Memories of Paradise.\nThe alffa dragon didn't speak much at first, but was patiently listening to its friends' stories.  One by one, all of them shared their most amazing memory of the night of the party, and when everyone turned to alffa dragon to ask for its best memory, it just let out a small laugh.  As it was all-seeing and witnessed everything that happened as they remembered it.  First turning to oaris dragon, alffa explained that the big party was already planned and it never approached razzle and dazzle for a talk.  Then, turning to the exandrew dragon - the mythic dragons turned its direction because of the loud thud that followed one of his attempts to fly.  Hanno's hair prevented it from seeing how good frond's handstand was.  Grove's friends were a little bit annoyed with how slow it was moving.  Delicia's dance was not as good as it remembered it.  And tebori - everyone was looking at it, but because they were in awe of the beautiful patterns.  Still, everyone had a great time that night and even the other night, and some new memories of paradise were created."

They couldn't get a flame lit with magic nor muscle. A burgleboo dragon just happened to pass and saw that these folks needed more than a little help. BOOM! Just then, a gumdrop flare fanned in the sky and this dragon knew just what to do. It snuck its way through the Vale until it saw an entire table filled with goodies. While a sugary plume clouded the confections, the burglehoo dragon slithered on its belly and snuck under the table undetected.\nOnly a few moments later, the hungry family heard a knock on their door. When they opened it, they saw a sweet feast waiting for them on a large table. They also saw the table had been dragged in the snow for some distance, accompanied by dragon tracks."

They all flapped their wings to pull away from the mudslide and suddenly the mountain shimmered with brilliant blue flashes all over. The aimless morpho dragons caught sight of Kaleni casting wind spell after wind spell at the baking breeding cave. They flew to his aid and surrounded the afflicted area. Kaleni didn't know what to expect. He had never seen so many morpho dragons in his life. They formed a giant cylinder, held their wings outstretched , then simultaneously flapped. They sent a cyclone of air spinning around the Burcadian Breeding Cave and it pushed Kaleni somersaulting into the back of the cave.\nKaleni vanished with his own spell and appeared on a nearby island, next to a wishing well, panting and sweaty. Ellie skipped by with an egg in her arms and saw the determined dragon display. \"Are they okay?\", she asked innocently.\nKaleni said, trying to catch his breath, \"Yeah, they're just blowing off some steam.\""

Some splashes were more daring, being seen a second too late right next or behind him. Frustrated by this, the moment he heard a splash nearby he leapt into the water to grab at the creature.

Everwhere a rose fell, color spread.\nThe amaryllis dragon, still sightless with eyes shut, gestured to the entire colorless Vale. Noel smiled and conjured a sack made of leaves.

It sizzled and disintegrated blades of grass underneath it.\nThe starving serket dragon licked the volatile berry juice. It grinned with delight and devoured the other felled berries. With a palpable taste for the unreachable treat, the serket baby unleashed a flurry of a tail-strikes. In no time at all, a deluge of fruit came pouring down. The baby tried to gobble it all as fast as it could, but there was too much.\nThe cascade of poisonous berries rolled down a long hill while the serket dragon ran to keep up with it, snatching up snacks as it ran. In the midst of its unbridled joy, the dragon saw a group of Vale youth playing at the bottom of the hill. The dragon trampled a few berries while it was distracted and saw the corrosive effect once more.\nIt curled its tail, formed a circle, and rolled faster than it could run. When it came to the bottom, it spun around and opened its mouth as wide as possible. Every berry tumbled down and into its mounth until all were captured. The wizardlings cheered and laughed at the sight of a serket dragon. The baby chewed and swallowed the sudden feast.

It came to a sudden stop right in front of him, and that's when it became clear: this was a derecho dragon getting its kicks from surfing the hight winds. The dragon winked and rocketed off.

Oaris was also very shy in nature, very quiet and would prefer to hide behind a tree or stay at home, but the amazing performance that dazzle gave in the Colosseum inspired it to come out of its shell. When it approached dazzle, it saw it talking to razzle and, with its huge ears, overheard them discussing how this party is a little boring. Summoning all it's courage, oaris decided to speak up and suggest we take this party to the next level by givin' it the ol' razzle dazzle treatment. What proceeded can only be described as EPIC. Few hours later, oaris was still covering its head with wings, but was beaming with excitement that the party had livened up again thanks to it speaking up.

Celebrating a DECAde of park owenership called for the most exquisite of party activities that the wizards could think of.  One of them was a giant baby fire dragon piñata, filled with delicious berries and beanstalks, everyone's favorite! Wizards and dragons alike tried to knock it down from the Sakura tree, but to no avail.  Until a large and magnificent dragon, unknown to the magicfolk, approached the piñata and started slashing its sharp wings.  Perhaps, this dragon was a result of a special summoning spell done by a very hungry and impatient wizard.  We might never know its origins, but it surely needed a name. Everyone shifted their attention towards the new elegant and shiny dragon and got to brainstorming a name for it.  \"Let's name it Ten, after the anniversary! It also has a ten sign on its chest!\" someone shouted.  Another yelled \"No it looks like it's made of tin, so let's name it that!\"  And so, half the folks started chanting \"Ten\", the other half \"Tin\" and they couldn't make up their minds.  Until someone suggested they just combine the two names and name it tien. We leave it up to you to decide though - is it a roman numeral on its chest or just an \"X marks the spot\" type of situation."

The fresh cold water soaked the dirt and saturated the ground. Instantly, burgeoning buds popped up everywhere.

It went to the edge of the stone and tried to push itself forward and fly away, but it instead leaped to the ground because its whole body was covered in some sort of sticky substance and the wings simply wouldn't move.\nTHE NIGHT BEFORE\nThe moriante dragon was taking a calm evening flight when it stumbled upon a circle of astronomancers having a party. They were singing, dancing and celebrating the longest day of the year, surrounded by endless barrels of sugary beanstalk juice. Even though it was getting late, the moriante dragon decided to join in and show everyone how it was done.\nA crazy skillful wizard was in the middle of the circle dancing to the music coming from nearby, and that really caught the dragon's attention. The wizard stepped aside to give the moriante dragon a chance...Ever since it's hatched, the moriante dragon is said to be very peaceful and calm, but it adores dancing. But little did they know, due to its chubby appearance, it is not always as graceful as it thinks.\nThe more interesting movements the dragon made, the more the crowd was applauding. Few minutes into the dancing fiasco though, the dragon tried to gracefully walk towards the public, but tripped on its tail and fell right into the barrels full of juice. Many of them broke under the weight and the whole thing was pouring onto the ground, and soon, everyone was knee deep in beanstalk juice.\nPRESENT DAY\nThe moriante dragon slightly blushed at the state of its body...Few astronomancers were cleaning the mess and carefully collecting the barrels pieces. It swiftly cleaned itself up and jumped to sweep all the wooden pieces together with its wings into a neat pile. While no one was looking, it quietly flew away without looking back, ashamed of last night's clumsy performance. \n A tired moriante dragon was softly snoozing atop a large stone, when a loud thud woke it up.

Until one day, a baby gatren emerged from the caves with its very own baby-stalagmite formation.  This opened a whole new can of cave worms for the Wizards.  Do gatren dragons age very slowly in the dark, are these just spinal growths serving as a form of crude camouflage or a mean of communication via echolocation?"

Jagged blue arcs grew and grew, creating and electric aura. When it became three times as big as the dragon, it unleashed the high voltage ball at the split mountain. It collided with the rocky mass and instantly shattered. The Surface formation crumbled on itself and the bright purple energy leak definitively ceased.\nThe outrider dragon was still circling as if nothing happened, until the sparkles dragon joined it and flew alongside.

It broke through a cloud and saw a spellform outrider dragon caught in a looping flight pattern. The sparkles dragon squinted, arched its shoulders, and sped toward the victim in the wind.

On land there aren't as many fish as you can imagine, so there their mobility is not as essential and is limited to bouncing on their bellies and attempts to lift themselves off the ground with their tiny wings.

Secluded away in his tower he spent every waking hour going through countless scrolls and graphs, detailing the mystical Nipong art of dragonsai.  Having gone through the texts more times than there are stairs in his tower, he was ready to tackle this newfound hobby.  Now all that was left was to wait for the dragonsai trees to sprout and grow.  As the days went on and his anticipation grew, it was clear he was losing the battle against boredom.  He knew he would either have to speed this up somehow or buy already grown dragonsai plants, and where is the fun in that?  Quickly he sprung into action, concocting a potion that would hasten the plant's growth.  He poured the first potion's contents into the pot and waited in silence to see what would happen.  He was shocked to see that absolutely nothing happened.  Frustrated by this failure, he tried again and again, potion after potion until the pot was overflowing with all kinds of chemicals, but sadly nothing seemed to work.  Having exhausted himself and all of his options, he decided to hit the sack.  The next morning he was met with a rude awakening as his tower as teeming with small bouncing tree-like critters.  Worried they would devour his newly sprouted plants, he stormed to the workshop only to find that these critters are the plants themselves, come to life as woodvine dragons."

Her ice sled collided with a frozen patch of begonias and sent her flying headfirst into a snow bank.\nWhen she pulled herself out, a baby begonia dragon charged toward her with the widest grin. The baby dragon tackled her and pushed her completely through the snow bank. It licked her face incessantly until Lumi was a cacophony of laughter and tickled gibberish.\nThey were so enamored with their instant bond, they chased each other, played hide and seek, and cuddled in the cold. The begonia dragon smelled food in Lumi's pocket and jabbed its nose in, unabashedly searching for the snack. Lumi writhed with giggles until her wand fell to the ground. It landed on ice, glowed, and projected a hologram of Gardenia decorating for the Gathering of Roses.\nLumi and the baby begonia dragon stopped playing and watched. The baby dragon saw Lumi's smile fade to a frown. While Lumi got lost in her grief once more, the baby dragon continued to rummage through Lumi's pockets. Lumi was not amused, but soon saw the dragon pull out a star pod treat. It gobbled it down and instantly grew into a juvenile.\nThe begonia dragon lowered its wing, which was now three times as big, and beckoned Lumi to climb on. She did and they continued their search from the sky with proud proficiency."

Their inherent magic, dormant at a quick glance.\nBut this is merely a misunderstanding; powers are used in moments of need  notwithstanding. Valefolk can be overt and garish, when sorcery is used to solve problems. But the first known quintessence dragon quelled a 500-year storm in perform and fantastic fashion:\nThe storm brought wicked winds, torrential rain, hellacious hail, and violent lightning. It caused chaos and panic amongst the witches and wizards. The Vale was fraught with disaster... until a quintessence dragon descended from the sky, with wings fully spread in total glory.\n It saw fires sparked by lightning strikes and unleashed water breath magic to extinguish the rampant flames. It saw magicfolk slipping into floods and roared with earth magic to raise the ground underneath the afflicted. Using the power of plant magic, the quintessence dragon conjured a path of leaves for Valers to follow to safety. Once they were all gathered in a single safe zone, the dragon shouted louder than any living creature ever had. Metal sheets emerged from the ground and surrounded the Valefolk to protect them from fierce winds. Then, with a final touch, the quintessence dragon spat a tiny fireball down to ignite a campfire. The witches and wizards kept warm and protected while the storm passed.\nThis is why quintessence dragons are so revered and pampered; not just as repayment for the Vale's survival, but to keep them close for the next tempest... should one arrive."

As they observed, they discovered this was no ordinary cyclone, but a cyclone dragon! The poor creature was dazzled by a hypnotic dragon, and had been stuck tornadoing through Witchitoto ever since. Thankfully, a simple right-round spell gave the cyclone dragon control of its movement again. What a whirlwind adventure!"

Soon after, a wandering stoneheart dragon stopped to snack on Mort's potion-powered pumpermellon plants. Fortunately, aside from a harmless case of stonescale, the dragon was unharmed. Still, Mort felt so guilty about the accident that he never touched a drop of love potion again, and thus, sadly, he was never united with his true love. Valefolk say the stoneheart dragon's seemingly sad expression is an ode to poor ol' Mort."

It looked up to see the trees all around it shrivel and dry. The grass turned brown and quickly encircled the eldritch dragon. As the unknown magic was inches away from the dragon, it flew up and out of harm's way.\nJust outside the forest, Lumi pointed up at the eldritch dragon flying out of the spreading danger. The scourge dragon rose up and flew over the escapee. Their wings touched and the eldritch dragon saw a grayness spread.

And what do you know--that dragon, in turn, rests on the back of yet *another* shelled dragon. And what, you ask, does that dragon teeter atop? Why, it's shelled dragons all the way down! So the legend goes, anyway."

Their involuntary behavior forms a makeshift tent to protect the creatures from rain and snow, but the prolonged formation llifts them into the air by sunrise. They serenely float along until gentle breezes rouse the dragons and they descend to start their day. Early risers in the Vale boast the beauty of this daily ritual but jealous friends say they're full of hot."

When they landed, the dragon woke up with a mighty yawn and looked around confused at its unfamiliar surroundings.  Thinking it was just a dream, it went back to sleep.

Though the cave was filled with fascinating and jeweled treasure, he became transfixed on a somewhat grimy lamp. Overtaken by the need to shine it up a bit, he suddenly found himself in front of a djinni dragon.\nHaving heard rumors of such fantastical creatures from legend, he did the first thing that came to mind: he wished for more wishes. This was of course against the rules of magic, and immediately and forever stripped the djinni dragons of any wish-granting powers they might have had."

Luckily, just when it seemed like the snow would never stop, a great wind whipped all of the fallen snow into the form of a dragon!

The duo would chase after the dragons, trying to get close enough to study them, only able to catch up when the dragons got tired.  The smigis weren't running away out of fear, however, they simply had fun running along with their new bipedal friends.  The dragons would curiously wonder why the wizards walk on their hind legs, but they didn't judge.  It is the sounds of cheering and laughter that brought them to the circus, excited by the possibility of showing off their agility, as well as making new strange friends."

Entering a thick fog on their way, they all started hearing a delightful tune that would gently caress their ears as if an angel had softly whispered into them. Only the celtic dragon wasn't enjoying it, covering its ears from the sound. Entranced by the tune, the captain ordered the helmsman to steer towards the source of the singing. Getting closer and closer, the alluring song became gradually louder and louder. And there, deep in the fog they discovered the source - a dragon as beautiful as a dream and as scary as a nightmare. With only the celtic dragon not under the alure dragon's charm, it tore off the sails of the ship and started dragging it backwards with all the strength it could muster. Once the crew were out of the fog, it could finally rest and take a breather. The sailors fashioned a new makeshift sail and made their way home and to this day they wonder, what would have happened if not for the help of that wizard's companion."

It let out a happy little chirp. A barrage of footsteps grew louder and louder until an avarice dragon appeared at the peak of anger. The sugarplum dragon recoiled, but soon saw the red, droopy eyes and sullen stance of the creature. The sugarplum dragon approached the weary one and saw its unforgiving living quarters. In no time at all, the sugarplum dragon had gathered straw and grass to form a much more comfortable bed for the avarice dragon. The avarice dragon inspected the bed as if it were a trap, then placed one paw gently on the bedding. It was soft. The avarice dragon plopped down and sighed heavily. the sugarplum dragon was so delighted it leaped and twirled with glee. Incidentally, this celebratory dance hypnotized the avarice dragon into a deep sleep."

Every year the wizards' feast was overflowing with treats like pumpermelon pie and berry bauble bonbons.  Just the thought of all those tasty goodies was making Kaleni's stomach rumble.  One day, Kaleni decided to go check in the larder, just to make sure that there were enough supplies for impending celebration.  But to his abject horror, Kaleni found the larder nearly empty!  This state of affairs was completely unacceptable to the wizard, and he was determined to make it right.  He hitched a sleigh to his trust Yule dragon and the two made their way out into the cold.  The snow outside was piled all the way to the roofs and the wind blew with biting force, but the steadfast yule dragon plowed through it all.  The pair stopped at each house and the yule dragon roared a melodious tune to get the residents' attention.  Kaleni explained their plight to the wizards they visited and each one gave generously.  By the end of the night, the treat pile on the sleigh was so tall that the yule dragon had to balance carefully to keep it all from toppling over.  Once the last of the treats were loaded into the larder, Kaleni looked at the hoard of generous donations and sighed with content.  The feast was saved.  His work complete, Kaleni tucked in for the night, but not before grabbing a couple Fiery Fig Fritters for a well-deserved snack."

They can deliver a blow with 1500 Newtons of force, which tells you what kind of weak punch a wizard must have.  That punch is so powerful that even kaiju dragons can't handle it.  Water moves out of the way so fast that little vacuums are formed, creating a shockwave of light and heat.  Talk about a one hit wonder.

If you were to sneak up on an unsuspecting herd of frostflowers, you can be certain they'd flee faster than an iceberg dragon in a fire habitat. But don't do that! That's just cold."

If their wings are too stiff to fly above the treetops, it can cause quite the panic... it's even worse if they have no wings at all. This happened to one unfortunate gulletail dragon, as it wandered and shivered in the night, looking for any relief from the bitter cold. It smelled what could only be a hot treat and followed its nose to a clearing. It found an oblivious nibwhip dragon stirring a witch's cauldron, billowing with steam. The gulletail dragon circled the clearing, trying to distract the helpful dragon with ominous noises. The nibwhip dragon finally broke its concentration and left the cauldron unattended to search for the cause of the ruckus. The gulletail dragon licked its lips and slithered toward the chocolaty goodness..."

He also noted in his journal that the heavy metal dragons, contrary to what folks would imagine, love to hang out in beautiful flowery fields.  Why - no one knows.

The dragon would be blindfolded and two giant buckets of ice cream would be presented, one with sprinkles on top, and one without.  Thinking it would just pick one and devour it, proving once and for all which way was better.  Instantly upon the removal of the blindfold, their companion went ballistic in excitement, jumping into the buckets and making a mess gobbling everything up.  With the dragon covered in all sorts of flavors and toppings, looking happier than ever, the Wizards realized there is no right way, as long as you enjoy it.  Both Wizards are still on the same page about Nubbleberries on pizzas though - they hate it."
